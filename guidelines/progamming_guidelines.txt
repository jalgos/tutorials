-Prefer understandability over conciseness. Verbosity and redundancy in naming variables is a good thing:



function_that_sums_all_the_goals_by_players > ftsatbp
vector_that_contains_all_the_scores > vec

Of course you want to write shorter names to keep your code readable
sum_goals_by_players
v_scores

-I personally prefer _ over CamelCase. More pleasing to the eye I think but some languages make extensive use of it. Worst thing to do is mix the two syntaxes (sometimes in the same name Sum_Goals_By_Players)






-Never copy paste code!
-Write a lot of functions. 
-Divide your code into small building blocks
-Try not to hardcode
